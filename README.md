# Generatev TV Scripts
Third Project made on my course of Deep Learning on Udacity.

In this project, I generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network that I built generated a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
